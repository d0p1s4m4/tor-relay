      </aside>
      Tor sees use by <a href="https://www.torproject.org/about/torusers">many important segments of the population</a>,
      including whistle blowers, journalists, Chinese dissidents skirting the Great Firewall and oppressive censorship,
      abuse victims, stalker targets, the US military, and law enforcement, just to name a few. While Tor is not
      designed for malicious computer users, it is true that they can use the network for malicious ends. In reality
      however, the actual amount of <a href="https://support.torproject.org/abuse/">abuse</a> is quite low. This is
      largely because criminals and hackers have significantly better access to privacy and anonymity than do the
      regular users whom they prey upon. Criminals can and do build, sell, and trade far larger and more powerful
      networks than Tor on a daily basis. Thus, in the mind of this operator, the social need for easily accessible
      censorship-resistant private, anonymous communication trumps the risk of unskilled bad actors, who are almost
      always more easily uncovered by traditional police work than by extensive monitoring and surveillance anyway.
      </p>
      <p>
        In terms of applicable law, the best way to understand Tor is to consider it a network of routers operating as
        common carriers, much like the Internet backbone. However, unlike the Internet backbone routers, Tor routers
        explicitly do not contain identifiable routing information about the source of a packet, and no single Tor node
        can determine both the origin and destination of a given transmission.
      </p>
      <p>
        As such, there is little the operator of this router can do to help you track the connection further. This
        router maintains no logs of any of the Tor traffic, so there is little that can be done to trace either
        legitimate or illegitimate traffic (or to filter one from the other). Attempts to seize this router will
        accomplish nothing.
